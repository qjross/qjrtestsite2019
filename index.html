<p>I have a rather dubious history with web design and development. I actually started to learn it back in 2015 via FreeCodeCamp. I did well with basic front-end concepts, but never really progressed past it. I felt that I could have learned better in a slightly more structured setting than I could with FCC because I would always start and stop otherwise.</p>
<p>What I hope to get out of this course is a much better understanding of Bootstrap and jQuery, as they were the two I was working on when I lost track. Along with that, I am also hoping to hone some soft skills that I have been weak on in the past, particularly adaptability and collaborative work.</p>
<p>As far as applying this new web knowledge goes, I hope to possibly use this, along with (begrudgingly) new social media skills in the world of sports as a lead designer and social media specialist for a bigtime team or league.</p>
